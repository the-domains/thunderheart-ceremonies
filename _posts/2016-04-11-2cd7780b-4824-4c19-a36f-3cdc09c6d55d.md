The cycles of experience that you move through should be honored by a celebration that emerges from who you are, not what others believe. When two people get married there is no better way to honor that union than to create a ceremony from the thing that is at the center of it all--their love. I take the story of your love and work with you to weave together an unforgettable ceremonial experience that will echo for you and all your loved ones forevermore. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/47eef65f-7093-40a4-8ce8-2e05ee506b23.jpg)
