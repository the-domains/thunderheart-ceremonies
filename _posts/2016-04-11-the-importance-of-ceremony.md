* _The ceremony is the centerpiece of your wedding because it's the point at which your love is being expressed openly and purposefully for all to see, for the first time. So many couples get lost in the drinks, the food, the djs and the decorations. And these are essential, but all of them hinge on how people feel emerging from your ceremony. Let me tell you when they leave that ceremony feeling the love, your love, I promise you the food will taste better, the people will dance harder, and celebration will abound because the ceremony has done its job: celebrated the true story of your love. No templates. No cookie cutter, cut and paste ceremonies. Your love is unlike anyone else's. So why shouldn't your ceremony be just as unique and expressive? Your love comes from who you are, and where you've been. It comes from how you found each other together and apart. Why shouldn't your ceremony be the same? _
